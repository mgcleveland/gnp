Title: Who was that masked man? The Legend of Klinton Spilsbury
Description: Resurrecting the Lone Ranger with Johnny Depp must've sounded like one of the all-time Hollywood no-brainers when it was pitched to Disney in 2011.

But getting The Lone Ranger into theaters has been a bumpy ride, with an enormous budget that nearly nixed the project before it even hit the trail, subsequent reports of cost-cutting rewrites, and a dangerous horseback accident that nearly mangled Depp himself.

Gore Verbinski&#039;s flamboyant re-imagination of the hokey long-running radio show and &#039;50s cowboy TV series, Depp eagerly attempts to recreate the extravagant magic of his similarly farcical Jack Sparrow of Verbinski&#039;s &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean.&quot; One would think that a so-costumed Depp careening through the Old West with Buster Keaton aplomb would make &quot;The Lone Ranger,&quot; at worst, entertaining. But Verbinski&#039;s film, stretching hard to both reinvent an out-of-date brand and breathe new life in the Western with a desperate onslaught of bloated set pieces, is a poor locomotive for Depp&#039;s eccentric theatrics. For 2 ¬Ω hours, the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; inflates, subverts and distorts the conventions of the Western until, in an interminable climax set to the William Tell Overture, the big-budget spectacle finally, exhaustingly collapses in a scrap heap of train wreckage. A talented filmmaker of great excess, Verbinski&#039;s ricocheting whimsy here runs off the rails. Flashback-heavy plot mechanics, occasionally grim violence (bullets land in bodies with the loudest of thwacks, a heart gets eaten) and surrealistic comedy add up to a confused tone that seems uncertain exactly how to position Depp&#039;s Tonto in the movie, to say nothing of Armie Hammer&#039;s wayward Lone Ranger. When Verbinski was last directing and Depp was a cartoon lizard, they crafted a far better Western in &quot;Rango.&quot; PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violence, and some suggestive material. Running time: 149 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.</p><br clear="all"/>

Kafka died four years later of tuberculosis. &nbsp;</p><p>The letter is a fascinating, albeit sometimes dark, perspective on parenting from the parented.
