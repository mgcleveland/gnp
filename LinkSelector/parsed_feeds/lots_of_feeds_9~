On Thursday, Snowden formally filed a request for citizenship to the Icelandic Parliament, according to Birgitta Jónsdóttir, member of the Icelandic Parliament for the Icelandic Pirate Party.

With assistance from a legal advisor to WikiLeaks, Snowden has requested political asylum from more than 20 countries, including Iceland, but none of the requests have been granted so far. Some countries have already rejected the requests on different grounds, including the fact that their laws require asylum requests to be made on their soil.

Parliament's resolution, which was approved by 483 votes to 98 with 65 abstentions, said that the European Commission, the Council of Ministers, and E.U. member states should consider "all levers at their disposal" in negotiations with the U.S., including suspending the current PNR and TFTP arrangements.

ICO has written to Google warning that its privacy policy raises serious questions about its compliance with U.K. data regulation. "In particular, we believe that the updated policy does not provide sufficient information to enable U.K. users of Google's services to understand how their data will be used across all of the company's products," the ICO said.

Title: Backlash occurs in Japan over sales of train e-ticket records
Description: A privacy debate has erupted in Japan over a new service from a major rail operator that sells private e-ticket records as marketing data. This week East Japan Railway (JR East), the country's largest rail company, has begun offering for sale the anonymized histories of millions of its passengers. The data is gleaned from its Suica train pass system, which is Japan's most popular with 43 million users, roughly equivalent to a third of the national population. JR East and Hitachi, which will handle the technical aspects of the service, announced it last week via a terse news release that initially drew little attention. But this is the first time Suica information has been sold to third parties, and the news was soon highlighted by prominent bloggers, triggering a discussion that has now spread to Twitter and other online forums. "Even if there is a proper way to use this (data), it must be done with the approval of society," wrote Hiromitsu Takagi, a professor and prominent commentator on data privacy, on his Twitter account.

Title: HTC Q2 profit down 83 percent
Description: HTC's second quarter net profit plummeted 83 percent year on year as sales of the company's latest flagship handset failed to meet expectations. The company reported net profit of $41.6 million, down from $2.4 billion a year earlier. Revenue totaled $2.3 billion, down 22 percent. Results for the quarter should have been boosted by sales of the new HTC One smartphone. It went on sale in April, although the company had originally hoped to launch it at the end of March. The delay put the HTC One in closer competition with Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S4 smartphone, which went on to reach sales of 10 million units within a month of its launch in late April. Tough battle with Apple, Samsung Heated competition with Samsung and Apple is a major reason for HTC's financial woes, analysts say. To revive its smartphone business, HTC in 2012 launched its new "One" series to help create more brand visibility. To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here
Title: Weekend Project! Install the Windows 8.1 preview
Description: It’s scorching out. Any housework that needs doing is already done. And with the long weekend ahead, it’s time for a simple computing project. Here’s one: Install the Windows 8.1 preview. Last week, Microsoft unveiled Windows 8.1, the next iteration of its Windows 8 operating system. From a marketing standpoint, Windows 8.1 is a do-over, a bid to simplify and personalize an operating system that, quite frankly, turned off a lot of people. If you own Windows 8 and dislike it, we encourage you to follow along and consider giving Windows 8.1 a try. Not only does it have features designed to make Windows 8.1 a friendlier experience, but it has tons—yes, tons—of new features. Note that, eventually, Windows 8.1 will be available to you, for free, when the software is released to “general availability,” most likely this fall. What Microsoft released last week is a preview, and so it may contain a bug or two. If you have any critical apps or data, make sure that you have backup copies, or that your data is also stored within Microsoft’s SkyDrive. Though I haven’t encountered a single bug in Windows 8.1, there’s no guarantee that you’ll have the same experience. Microsoft A prettier Start page. We think it makes a difference. If you do run into problems, try visiting the Microsoft Windows 8 Preview forums. You’ll find answers to specific questions that this guide can’t cover, including the most frustrating error message, “Windows 8.1 Preview is not yet supported on this PC.” (Have you already seen this message? According to Microsoft, your PC might be running a 32-bit Intel Atom chip that’s currently unsupported.) To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here
Title: Samsung predicts big earnings jump in Q2, still disappoints
Description: Samsung Electronics predicted a big jump in profit for the second quarter compared to a year earlier, but the company's explosive growth is slowing amid signs its top end Galaxy smartphones are less popular than expected. Samsung said Friday that its operating profit for the April-June quarter will probably be between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion. This is at least a 44 percent gain from what it generated during the same stretch in 2012, and Samsung said sales are also likely up around 20 percent. Those are strong gains, but analysts and investors had expected better. Bloomberg said a survey of 34 financial analysts predicted an average of $8.7 billion in earnings. A number of investment banks have cut their ratings on the Korean company in recent weeks, and its stock has fallen. Bolstered by the Galaxy S4 The results correspond to the launch of Samsung's flagship Galaxy S4, released in April. The phone was a highly anticipated follow-up to Samsung's successful S3, and the company held a major launch event at New York City's Radio City Music Hall, with a live broadcast to people watching in nearby Times Square.

Title: Court in Pakistan orders YouTube block to continue
Description: A court in Pakistan has ordered a continuation of the block on YouTube in the country, after the government argued that a removal of the ban would have implications on law and order in the country. YouTube was banned in Pakistan in September over a controversial video clip, called "Innocence of Muslims," which mocked Prophet Muhammad. The country's telecom regulator said it was blocking the entire site as it was not able to separately block individual URLs (uniform resource locators) linking to copies of the video. The plaintiff, Bytes For All, Pakistan, has argued that the PTA has Internet filtering technology that is already used to selectively filter Internet content, said Shahzad Ahmad, country director, of the civil rights group on Friday. A report released in June by Citizen Lab, based at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, claimed, for example, that Pakistan is actively filtering content, with Netsweeper filtering devices actively used to censor content on an ISP-wide level in Pakistan. Bytes for All had asked the court for an interim order unblocking YouTube. "We wanted the government to go ahead and block the 700 to 800 URLs with the blasphemous content, and remove the block on the rest of the site," Ahmad said. He alleged that the government is intent on continuing to block YouTube as part of its overall plan to control Internet access in the country. The YouTube issue is part of a broader petition by Bytes For All against Internet censorship in the country. To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here
Title: Internet Explorer pegged for critical fix on Tuesday
Description: Microsoft's monthly patch release for July will cover seven security issues, six of which could be remotely exploited by an attacker. The company publishes an advisory in advance of its patch date, which is the second Tuesday of the month, so administrators knows what products will be affected. It does not describe the vulnerabilities, however, until the security fixes are released. The critical vulnerabilities are in the Windows OS, .NET Framework, Silverlight, Office, Visual Studio, Lync and Internet Explorer (IE). A seventh bulletin, ranked as "important," affects Microsoft's Windows Defender security software. The most important bulletin addresses IE, wrote Wolfgang Kandek, CTO for Qualys. It affects IE versions six through 10 on Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, Server 2003, Server 2008 and RT. To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here
Title: Secure messaging project, Cryptocat, apologizes over bug
Description: The founder of an eavesdropping-resistant instant messaging application called Cryptocat has apologized over a now-fixed bug that made some types of messages more vulnerable to snooping. Cryptocat, which runs inside a web browser, is an open-source application intended to provide users with a high degree of security by using encryption to scramble messages. But Cryptocat warns that users should still be very cautious with communications and not to trust their life with the application. The vulnerability, found by Steve Thomas, affected group chats and not private conversations, said Nadim Kobeissi, in an interview from Germany Friday. The encryption keys used to encode those conversations were too short, which in theory made it easier for an attacker to decrypt and read conversations. The error was the result of an oversight spotted by Thomas, Kobeissi said. The encrypted conversations were still carried over SSL (Secure Sockets Layers), another overlay of encryption. But if an attacker broke the SSL encryption and had the underlying encrypted chats, "it would be significantly easier to crack" using brute-force techniques, he said.

Title: 'Darkleech' malware attacks servers, demands ransom
Description: A persistent, widespread malware campaign that utilizes compromised Apache servers is locking users' computers and demanding a fee of $300 to free their data. Researchers from Eset wrote that the ransomware scam is an extension of a long-running attack that compromises the infrastructure of web hosting companies with a variant of a malicious Apache module called "Darkleech." "Malicious modification of server binaries seems to be a very popular trend for malware distribution," wrote Sebastien Duquette, an Eset malware researcher, on a company blog. Eset also suspects that hackers also may have figured out how to compromise CPanel and Plesk, which are both software programs used by hosting companies to manage their networks and websites.

Title: EU Parliament OKs stricter penalties for cyber attacks
Description: Cyber criminals could face tougher penalties across the European Union under new rules adopted by the European Parliament, which include the creation of a specific offense of using botnets. The draft directive adopted by the parliament on Thursday defines specific criminal offenses for cybercrime and sets specific sanctions for each. It also requires E.U. countries to assist fellow member states and respond to urgent requests for help within eight hours in the event of a cyber attack. The text has already been informally agreed with member states, and that agreement is expected to be formalized shortly. The member states will the have two years to implement it in national law. Under the draft law, using botnets to establishing remote control over a significant number of computers by infecting them with malicious software carries a penalty of at least three years' imprisonment.

Title: China sees rise in international Trojan and botnet attacks
Description: China saw an increase in Trojan and botnet attacks coming from other countries in 2012, as the amount of mobile malware in the country also surged, according to a local security group. During the year, a total of 73,000 Trojan and botnet command-and-control servers had hijacked 14.2 million host machines in the country. The number of Trojan and botnet servers marks an almost 60 percent increase from 2011. Close to 13,000 of those servers were based in the U.S., the country also responsible for the largest number of Trojan and botnet attacks targeting China. South Korea was second, followed by Germany. China's National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team (CNCERT) reported the figures on Thursday. They were later published by the nation's state press, Xinhua News Agency.

Title: Google faces sanctions in Europe over privacy policy
Description: A German data protection authority has begun a formal action against Google over changes the company made to its privacy policy last year. The French privacy regulator announced a similar action last month. The Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information announced Thursday that it will join other European privacy regulators in taking action against the company. The French National Commission on Computing and Liberty (CNIL) announced last month that it had given Google three months to respond to its complaints or face court action, after the company repeatedly rejected requests to reverse changes it made to its privacy policy in March 2012. Spain's privacy regulator too has notified Google of its intention to impose sanctions if Google does not comply with Spanish law.

Title: Stop spying on us, European Parliament tells US
Description: The European Parliament gave European Commissioners and national ministers some extra ammunition Thursday in discussions with the U.S. following allegations about American spying and the Prism scandal: possible suspension of data-sharing agreements. The Parliament called on the U.S. to provide full disclosure of any spying activities, and set up an inquiry to look into the allegations, but stopped short of suspending bilateral trade talks due to start on Monday. The resolution was approved by 483 votes to 98 with 65 abstentions. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) said that the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and E.U. member states should consider "all levers at their disposal" in negotiations with the U.S., including suspending deals for sharing air passenger (Passenger Name Record) data and bank data (the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme). Assess European programs, too The resolution also expresses grave concern that similar surveillance programs may be run by E.U. member states, including the U.K., Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and Poland. It calls on those countries to examine whether their programs are compatible with E.U. law. To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here

Title: Internet fills gap as some TV stations shut down in Egypt
Description: The Internet held up in Egypt as the military deposed the country's president Wednesday, with both the former president's aides and the opposition using Twitter and Facebook extensively to communicate with followers in Egypt and the rest of the world. "Egypt remains online. So far no repeat of 2011," said Internet monitoring company Renesys in a Twitter message late Wednesday. It said it was continuing to monitor. In January 2011, the government of former president Hosni Mubarak ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet in the wake of widespread unrest in the country. This time, Egyptians on both sides used social media services using hashtags like #WeAreWithMorsi and #EgyptRevolutionNotMilitaryCoup, as the military cut off many TV channels and news sources, according to reports.

Title: July 4 Online protests against NSA surveillance start slowly
Description: An online protest against the surveillance programs of the U.S. National Security Agency planned for July 4 was off to a slow start Thursday morning, despite expectations it would see participation from thousands of websites. The action is part of a larger movement called Restore the Fourth—a reference to the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—that is also expected to include live protests in dozens of cities across the U.S. Organizations who are part of the Internet Defense League, a loose coalition committed to defending Internet freedom, were expected to participate in the July 4 online protest by displaying a message against "NSA spying" on their websites using a banner or a modal window. However, as of 8 a.m. Eastern Time, only a few of the high-profile Internet Defense League supporting websites were showing the protest message. Many of the participating websites belonged to civil rights organizations. They included 4chan, The Electronic Frontier Foundation, O'Reilly Media, Piwik, Free Press, Accessnow.org, and ColorOfChange.org. To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here
Title: Have a productive picnic: Hotspots, chargers and more for the great outdoors
Description: Heading off to the great outdoors is all about leaving the trappings of the modern world behind—but maybe not all your tech. Emergency alerts on your phone, or a quick search to see if those tasty-looking berries you found are safe to eat, are just a couple of good reasons to have a smartphone handy. And then there’s the fun stuff, like listening to music while you fish, or sharing photos with friends who couldn’t make the trip. Keeping your gadgets humming while you commune with nature does take planning, though. Here’s some gear that’ll turn your next outdoor adventure into one you can track, share, and enjoy without necessarily breaking the bank.
Title: Review: Acer's Aspire U (model A5600U-UB13) is a stylish AIO with a few minor flaws
Description: Done up in black and clear plastic, the Aspire U has a clean, modern look. The computer looks like an oversize picture frame, supported in the front by a clear plastic panel running its width and in the back by an articulating kickstand. This design lets you angle the Aspire U from nearly flat on the desk to nearly straight up. It’s an effective design if you have plenty of desk space or table area to work with. If you want to buy an all-in-one to maximize storage area in a small workspace, forget it: The area behind the Aspire U is completely blocked off. ROBERT CARDIN The clear front panel gives the Acer Aspire U a modern look, but it prevents you from sliding the keyboard underneath the PC when you’re not using it. The styled-to-match wireless keyboard and mouse bundled with the Aspire U are both pleasant surprises. The keyboard has a slightly sloppy feel, but the keys offer plenty of travel and feel quite nice overall. The up and down arrow keys are half-size, which makes them difficult to use, but the keyboard includes a numeric keypad that you can use for navigation (when Num Lock is turned off). The mouse has a nice heft, and it tracks well on just about any surface. The touchscreen display responds well to finger movements, and the Aspire U has one of the nicest webcams out there. It’s HD, and it provides very smooth video—significantly smoother than usual. The Aspire U can also respond to hand gestures via said webcam, though in truth it's a rather strenuous and inaccurate way to navigate Windows. Components and performance The A5600U-UB13 model of the Aspire U that we tested was sprightly enough, subjectively—once the Windows 8 operating system worked its caching magic. Until things were cached, however, the sluggish 1TB, 5400-rpm hard drive caused windows and applications to open rather slowly. This is a machine that you’d rather have hibernate or sleep than shut down, lest all that caching go for naught. Acer doesn’t offer an SSD option, which would have worked miracles in both perceived and actual speed. To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here

Title: Ex-Windows 8 chief agrees not to badmouth Microsoft, gets stock payout
Description: Microsoft’s former head of Windows 8 development has agreed not to badmouth Microsoft or work for some of its competitors and in return will receive a payout for unvested stock in the company, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. The “retirement agreement” with Steven Sinofsky, who left Microsoft in November after leading the development of its Windows 8 OS and Surface tablet, is described by Microsoft in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Sinofsky has agreed to not compete with Microsoft by accepting a job at certain competitors, which were not named, or encouraging customers to move away from its products. He’s also agreed not to solicit Microsoft employees to work at other companies, not to “disparage” Microsoft and not to take part in any litigation against the company, the filing says. In return, Microsoft will pay Sinofsky the value of his outstanding unvested stock options up to the start of Microsoft’s 2013 fiscal year, which began last July, and award him other stock compensation.

Title: Douglas Engelbart, inventor of the computer mouse, has died
Description: Douglas Engelbart, a Silicon Valley engineer who invented the computer mouse and is credited with many of the concepts that underpin modern computing and the Internet, died on Tuesday at his home in Atherton, California. He was 88. Born in 1925, Engelbart was coming of age as World War II raged in Europe. He joined the U.S. Navy as an electronic and radar technician, and after the war studied electrical engineering at Oregon State University. He went on to complete a master’s degree and Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was also an assistant professor. About a year later, in 1957, he joined the Stanford Research Institute (today called SRI International), which was just over a decade old. From 1959 until 1977 he led the organization’s Augmentation Research Center, and in 1963 came up with the concept of the computer mouse.

Title: Yahoo buys Xobni; some products have a year to live
Description: Yahoo said Friday that it has bought contact management specialist Xobni for an undisclosed amount, presumably to enhance Yahoo Mail and its related applications. But as to the future of Xobni’s own products—well, that’s not exactly clear. Xobni released a  FAQ indicating that the company plans to continue supporting its contact management tools for Outlook, but that other platforms may expire on July 2, 2014. In a sense, that means that Xobni’s statements about continuing support could be seen as a bit disingenuous. “Not to worry — we aren’t pulling the rug out from under you. If you’re using a Xobni product today, you can keep using it,” the Xobni team said in a blog post. However, Xobni won’t be accepting any more premium subscriptions, including  Xobni Pro, Xobni Enterprise, Xobni for Teams, the Xobni Salesforce Gadget, and the Xobni JIRA Gadget, the company said. Smartr Contacts for Android and Xobni for BlackBerry are no longer officially available for download, although the Android app will be pulled by the end of the day, the company said.

Description: Box, the red-hot provider of the eponymous cloud storage and file-sharing service, will boost the collaboration capabilities of its product in the next 18 months, and could become a publicly traded company next year or in 2015.

Title: Oracle quietly slashes BI software prices
Description: Oracle has quietly cut the list price of its flagship BI (business intelligence) Foundation Suite significantly, possibly in response to increased market competition.

Title: How to fix a broken favicon
Description: A couple days ago, I fired up my Web browser to discover that my Facebook "favicon" (the little icon that appears on the favorites toolbar right below the address bar) had changed. In place of that familiar little blue "f," I was looking at some grayish approximation of a sailboat sail. I'm not sure how it happened or why, but fortunately all my other favicons looked fine. Needless to say, I wanted to restore the Facebook icon to normal. But how? I tried right-clicking the icon in search of some related setting, finding Edit the only likely choice. Nope, nothing helpful there. Then I took to the Web, searching for articles on fixing broken favicons in Google Chrome, but found surprisingly little info on the subject. Apparently I could wipe the entire favicons database and then restart Chrome, but that seemed a little extreme—and I'd have to revisit every bookmarked site to get its favicon to reload.

Title: Preview version of Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials comes with new nag feature
Description: A preview version of Windows Server 2012 R2 is now out, complete with a nag feature aimed at administrators. The new preview pushes related Microsoft services at SMBs via a dashboard that will "remind" administrators to use them. Customers who subscribe to Microsoft's sunsetting TechNet service can now download it. Since it's a preview version, administrators should probably not test it on production hardware. Microsoft also said that features could be tweaked before the final release, but did not announce a shipping date. Users cannot upgrade from an existing installation of Windows Server 2012 to the R2 release; they must, instead, perform a migration, executives said.

That means some suspects are being convicted based on locational data of what towers their cell phones are pinging, and others are not, because some courts are requiring warrants and others don't.

Title: Nokia’s 41-megapixel smartphone now said to launch as Lumia 909
Description: We are less than a week away from Nokia’s press event that will reveal the company’s upcoming smartphone with a 41-megapixel camera. The handset, which is code-named EOS, was reportedly set to launch as the Lumia 1020. According to new information from @evleaks, however, it will now be released as the Lumia 909. The naming scheme makes sense because the 909 is the successor to Nokia’s earlier 41-megapixel smartphone, the Symbian-powered Nokia 808 PureView. The latest rumors suggest the phone will include a polycarbonate case and a 4.5-inch display with 720p resolution, and leaked images previously revealed that the Lumia 909 will be available on AT&T. Nokia will announce the smartphone at a press conference in New York City on
Title: Samsung’s meltdown is nothing like Apple’s
Description: Samsung has a problem on its hands. Despite getting ready to post a record profit of roughly $8.3 billion on $50 billion in revenue for the second quarter, the company’s stock price continues to slide. Analysts had high expectations for Samsung, estimating that the company would post profits of $8.9 billion in the second quarter. There are now fears that Samsung won’t be able to maintain the rapid growth it has enjoyed in the smartphone market in recent years. Sound familiar? It should — analysts had similar concerns with Apple, which eventually led to the company’s share price dipping below $500 for the first time in over a year. Brian Marshall of ISI, per CNN Money, noted that shares of both Apple

Title: The specter of a smartphone slow-down haunts the industry

This is starting to look ominous, even though each company has its own reasons for soggy spring numbers. Of course, Samsung’s profit miss is the biggest news item here — the company had lulled investors into complacency by beating expectations even during quarters when it did not have a brand new flagship phone in its product range. During the second quarter this year, Samsung had a brand new Galaxy S4 in its arsenal ramping up faster than any of its previous high-end phones, and its profit still missed expectations. HTC also had a brand new, well-reviewed model out during the spring quarter. One

In a press release titled “Blackberry’s Future Further Endangered By Physical Keyboard Case: Keasy,” a small U.K.-based upstart is looking to exploit BlackBerry’s woes in an effort to gain backers for its KickStarter project, which offers a protective case for the Galaxy S III smartphone that features a detachable physical keyboard.

Description: Apple’s iPhone 5 might be the best-selling smartphone in the world, but a new study suggests it is also the “most hated.” The Daily Mail points us to a study conducted by U.K.-based social media agency We Are Social that analyzed chatter on Twitter, blogs and forums following the launches of the iPhone 5, Galaxy S4, Lumia 920 and BlackBerry Z10. After tracking the responses and comparing each of the four devices, the firm found that 20% of the posts discussing the iPhone 5 were complaints. This compares to 18% of posts that complained about the BlackBerry Z10 and 15% that griped about Nokia’s Lumia 920. Just 11% of posts covering the Galaxy S4 were complaints, leading We Are Social to conclude

But then, the man finds himself with a Samsung Galaxy S4 and all his problems are solved — so he dances with four burglars and a sheep to celebrate. The ad closes with the man taking a big bite out of an Apple while holding a Galaxy S4 to his ear, and the sheep seems to

Description: Reports from earlier this week suggested that AT&T is ready to follow in its rivals’ footsteps and begin selling the private usage data it collects from its subscribers’ phones to advertisers. The data in question is anonymized, according to AT&T, but it includes very sensitive information such as customers’ locations, Web browsing history, mobile app usage and more.

Title: Apple’s latest move worries PC vendor rivals
Description: Apple recently filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a new type of computer port that combines a memory card reader with a standard USB port. The move seems somewhat innocuous on the surface, but Digitimes’ unnamed supply chain sources say rival computer makers are very worried over this new filing. According to the report, notebook vendors believe the new technology will give Apple yet another edge over their laptop computers in terms of design and thinness, because Apple will be able to make its new MacBook line of computers even slimmer by combining these ports. Apple already has design patents that cover the MacBook Air’s wedge design, the report noted, and this allows Apple to
Title: Welcome to Apple’s world: Samsung tumbles despite record $8.3 billion Q2 profit
Description: Samsung shares tumbled almost 4% on Friday as the company pre-announced record second-quarter earnings that still missed analysts’ sky-high consensus. The South Korean consumer electronics giant estimates that Q2 2013 profit came in at a record-high $8.3 billion on $50 billion in revenue, but analysts were looking for a quarterly profit of more than $8.9 billion. Despite the fact that Galaxy S4 shipments remained strong last month — Samsung reportedly topped 20 million units shipped cumulatively earlier this week — analysts are still worried that Samsung cannot maintain the rapid growth it has enjoyed in its smartphone division. Samsung’s Q2 earnings estimate of $8.3 billion represents a 47% increase over the same quarter in 2012 and an 8% improvement over
