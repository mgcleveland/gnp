Title: Who was that masked man? The Legend of Klinton Spilsbury
Description: Resurrecting the Lone Ranger with Johnny Depp must've sounded like one of the all-time Hollywood no-brainers when it was pitched to Disney in 2011. After all, the mysterious masked man used to be the all-American icon with the greatest chase-music ("The William Tell Overture"), the greatest sidekick (Tonto), and the greatest catchphrase ("Hi-yo, Silver, away!"). Plus, though Depp was playing a boldly reimagined Tonto opposite Armie Hammer's Ranger, he was reuniting with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski, the creative triumvirate that made Disney billions with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. But getting The Lone Ranger into theaters has been a bumpy ride, with an enormous budget that nearly nixed the project before it even hit the trail, subsequent reports of cost-cutting rewrites, and a dangerous horseback accident that nearly mangled Depp himself.

Gore Verbinski&#039;s flamboyant re-imagination of the hokey long-running radio show and &#039;50s cowboy TV series, Depp eagerly attempts to recreate the extravagant magic of his similarly farcical Jack Sparrow of Verbinski&#039;s &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean.&quot; One would think that a so-costumed Depp careening through the Old West with Buster Keaton aplomb would make &quot;The Lone Ranger,&quot; at worst, entertaining. But Verbinski&#039;s film, stretching hard to both reinvent an out-of-date brand and breathe new life in the Western with a desperate onslaught of bloated set pieces, is a poor locomotive for Depp&#039;s eccentric theatrics. For 2 ½ hours, the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; inflates, subverts and distorts the conventions of the Western until, in an interminable climax set to the William Tell Overture, the big-budget spectacle finally, exhaustingly collapses in a scrap heap of train wreckage. A talented filmmaker of great excess, Verbinski&#039;s ricocheting whimsy here runs off the rails. Flashback-heavy plot mechanics, occasionally grim violence (bullets land in bodies with the loudest of thwacks, a heart gets eaten) and surrealistic comedy add up to a confused tone that seems uncertain exactly how to position Depp&#039;s Tonto in the movie, to say nothing of Armie Hammer&#039;s wayward Lone Ranger. When Verbinski was last directing and Depp was a cartoon lizard, they crafted a far better Western in &quot;Rango.&quot; PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violence, and some suggestive material. Running time: 149 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.</p><br clear="all"/>

Title: Franz Kafka Google doodle: 130 years later, would Kafka still be mad at Dad?
Description: <p><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/tags/topic/Franz+Kafka" title="Title: Franz Kafka" target="_self" class="inform_link" rel="nofollow">Franz Kafka</a>, author of &quot;The Metamorphosis,&quot; is celebrated on his birthday today with a Google doodle. &quot;The Metamorphosis'&quot; main character's relationship with his father, especially after he turns into an insect, is denoted with physical violence and forced isolation — not unlike Kafka's relationship with his own father, writes Ernst Pawel in his biography (&quot;The Nightmare of Reason: A Life of Franz Kafka&quot;) of the writer.&nbsp;</p><p>That relationship was described by Kafka in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/csps.com/document/d/1CK480j6khmHzAZYdR26Zu1Iu064uCo32JnESIulbFYw/preview?pli=1" target="_blank">a 100-page handwritten &quot;Letter to my Father.&quot;</a> Written in ten days in November 1919, Kafka apparently hoped that the letter could lead to a reconciliation between him and a father he describes as hypocritical, emotionally abusive, and punishingly demanding.&nbsp;</p><p>From one passage in the letter: &quot;Your extremely effective rhetorical methods in bringing me up, which never failed to work with me, were: abuse, threats, irony, spiteful laughter, and – oddly enough – self-pity.&quot;</p><p>Kafka asked his mother to deliver the letter to his father for him, but she later refused and gave the letter back. Kafka died four years later of tuberculosis. &nbsp;</p><p>The letter is a fascinating, albeit sometimes dark, perspective on parenting from the parented. Here are a few quotations from Kafka's letter to his father that, taken together, may offer some wisdom on the don'ts and don'ts of raising children.&nbsp;</p><div class="feedflare">
