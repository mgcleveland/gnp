Title: Samsung’s meltdown is nothing like Apple’s
Description: Samsung has a problem on its hands. Despite getting ready to post a record profit of roughly $8.3 billion on $50 billion in revenue for the second quarter, the company’s stock price continues to slide. Analysts had high expectations for Samsung, estimating that the company would post profits of $8.9 billion in the second quarter. There are now fears that Samsung won’t be able to maintain the rapid growth it has enjoyed in the smartphone market in recent years. Sound familiar? It should — analysts had similar concerns with Apple, which eventually led to the company’s share price dipping below $500 for the first time in over a year. Brian Marshall of ISI, per CNN Money, noted that shares of both Apple

Title: The specter of a smartphone slow-down haunts the industry
Description: BlackBerry missed BB10 shipment expectations by more than 20%. HTC missed profit expectations by more than 30%. Even Samsung missed profit expectations by 10%. This is starting to look ominous, even though each company has its own reasons for soggy spring numbers. Of course, Samsung’s profit miss is the biggest news item here — the company had lulled investors into complacency by beating expectations even during quarters when it did not have a brand new flagship phone in its product range. During the second quarter this year, Samsung had a brand new Galaxy S4 in its arsenal ramping up faster than any of its previous high-end phones, and its profit still missed expectations. HTC also had a brand new, well-reviewed model out during the spring quarter. One

Title: BlackBerry woes exploited in effort to sell smartphone cases
Description: The past week has been among the roughest BlackBerry has seen in recent history as its share price plunged more than 25% following a huge earnings flop. As analysts continue to back away from the stock and paint ever-worsening pictures of BlackBerry’s future in their research, a small startup has managed to find a new way to kick BlackBerry while it’s down. In a press release titled “Blackberry’s Future Further Endangered By Physical Keyboard Case: Keasy,” a small U.K.-based upstart is looking to exploit BlackBerry’s woes in an effort to gain backers for its KickStarter project, which offers a protective case for the Galaxy S III smartphone that features a detachable physical keyboard.

Description: Apple’s iPhone 5 might be the best-selling smartphone in the world, but a new study suggests it is also the “most hated.” The Daily Mail points us to a study conducted by U.K.-based social media agency We Are Social that analyzed chatter on Twitter, blogs and forums following the launches of the iPhone 5, Galaxy S4, Lumia 920 and BlackBerry Z10. After tracking the responses and comparing each of the four devices, the firm found that 20% of the posts discussing the iPhone 5 were complaints. This compares to 18% of posts that complained about the BlackBerry Z10 and 15% that griped about Nokia’s Lumia 920. Just 11% of posts covering the Galaxy S4 were complaints, leading We Are Social to conclude
Title: Video: Samsung takes a bite out of Apple in bizarre new commercial
Description: It’s never easy to understand foreign television commercials without knowing the local language and culture, but nothing is lost in translation in Samsung’s latest TV spot in Iceland. The ad begins with a man trying repeatedly to make phone calls on his Apple. Not on an iPhone, but on an actual Apple. Needless to say, this doesn’t work out very well and he grows depressed. But then, the man finds himself with a Samsung Galaxy S4 and all his problems are solved — so he dances with four burglars and a sheep to celebrate. The ad closes with the man taking a big bite out of an Apple while holding a Galaxy S4 to his ear, and the sheep seems to

Title: How to stop AT&T from selling your private data to advertisers
Description: Reports from earlier this week suggested that AT&T is ready to follow in its rivals’ footsteps and begin selling the private usage data it collects from its subscribers’ phones to advertisers. The data in question is anonymized, according to AT&T, but it includes very sensitive information such as customers’ locations, Web browsing history, mobile app usage and more. Privacy is something of a hot button issue right now, so it is likely that a number of AT&T subscribers would prefer to not have their private data sold to advertisers. Luckily, there is a fast and easy way to opt out of AT&T’s “External Marketing and Analytics Reporting” program, and complete instructions follow below.

Title: Apple’s latest move worries PC vendor rivals
Description: Apple recently filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a new type of computer port that combines a memory card reader with a standard USB port. The move seems somewhat innocuous on the surface, but Digitimes’ unnamed supply chain sources say rival computer makers are very worried over this new filing. According to the report, notebook vendors believe the new technology will give Apple yet another edge over their laptop computers in terms of design and thinness, because Apple will be able to make its new MacBook line of computers even slimmer by combining these ports. Apple already has design patents that cover the MacBook Air’s wedge design, the report noted, and this allows Apple to
Title: Welcome to Apple’s world: Samsung tumbles despite record $8.3 billion Q2 profit
Description: Samsung shares tumbled almost 4% on Friday as the company pre-announced record second-quarter earnings that still missed analysts’ sky-high consensus. The South Korean consumer electronics giant estimates that Q2 2013 profit came in at a record-high $8.3 billion on $50 billion in revenue, but analysts were looking for a quarterly profit of more than $8.9 billion. Despite the fact that Galaxy S4 shipments remained strong last month — Samsung reportedly topped 20 million units shipped cumulatively earlier this week — analysts are still worried that Samsung cannot maintain the rapid growth it has enjoyed in its smartphone division. Samsung’s Q2 earnings estimate of $8.3 billion represents a 47% increase over the same quarter in 2012 and an 8% improvement over

The struggling smartphone vendor on Friday released earnings estimates for the second quarter that missed analysts’ consensus by a wide margin. HTC’s unaudited results show a profit that plummeted 83% to approximately $41.6 million last quarter, while revenue fell 22% to $2.4 billion. Analysts were looking for a $66.6 million profit for the second quarter. The results are an improvement over the worst-ever earnings HTC reported in the first quarter this year, but the launch of the HTC One did not have as munch of an impact as analysts were
